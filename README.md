# Haiku Me!

## Work In Progress

- A small but fun little front-end app that will allow a user to click a button and read a Haiku. Every click will bring up a new Haiku.

- Just to put a smile on people's faces :)

- Working to expand the amount of Haikus to at least 100 to start.

## Stretch Goal

- I would like to also add another button that will actually generate a Haiku. This is still a work in progress as checking syllable count is proving challenging. I think there could be some hilarious results with a computer generated Haiku. Stay Tuned...
